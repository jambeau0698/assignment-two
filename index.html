        <p id="para1"> <b>Helen Adams Keller</b> <i>(June 27, 1880 â€“ June 1, 1968)</i> was an American author, disability     rights advocate, political activist and lecturer. Born in West Tuscumbia, Alabama, she lost her sight and her hearing after a bout of illness when she was 19 months old. She then communicated primarily using home signs until the age of seven, when she met her first teacher and life-long companion Anne Sullivan. Sullivan taught Keller language, including reading and writing. After an education at both specialist and mainstream schools, Keller attended Radcliffe College of Harvard University and became the first deafblind person in the United States to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree.</p>        
        <p id="para1"> Keller was also a prolific author, writing 14 books and hundreds of speeches and essays on topics ranging from animals to Mahatma Gandhi.[3] Keller campaigned for those with disabilities, for women's suffrage, labor rights, and world peace. In 1909, she joined the Socialist Party of America (SPA). She was a founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)</p>
        <p id="para1"> Keller's autobiography, The Story of My Life (1903), publicized her education and life with Sullivan. It was adapted as a play by William Gibson, and this was also adapted as a film under the same title, The Miracle Worker. Her birthplace has been designated and preserved as a National Historic Landmark. Since 1954 it has been operated as a house museum[5] and sponsors an annual "Helen Keller Day".</p>
       <p id="para1">At 19 months old, Keller contracted an unknown illness described by doctors as "an acute congestion of the stomach and the brain".[16] Contemporary doctors believe it might have been meningitis, caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus),[17] or possibly Haemophilus influenzae. (This could have caused the same symptoms, but is a less likely cause due to its 97% juvenile mortality rate at that time.)[9][18] The illness left Keller both deaf and blind. She lived, as she recalled in her autobiography, "at sea in a dense fog".[19] </p>
